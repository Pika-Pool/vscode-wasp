# TODO: This grammar is a very simple, quick and dirty solution and it will not work in 100% cases.
#   Due to how quickly is Wasp changing, it makes sense to keep it light, not 100% precise for now,
#   and fix it as we go, and in the future we can look into more permanent options: 
#   either investing much more time into it and making it 100%,
#   or dropping it completely and switching directly to semantic analysis
#   via external service -> meaning that we feed the content of file to Wasp parser and it returns
#   tokens. If that can be made to work fast enough, that could be attractive solution,
#   to avoid maintaing this grammar (such approach is called "semantic highlighting" in vs code docs).
#   Ultimate solution would be to implement Wasp language server (LSP).
